A blog about my work as a frontend engineer. I will try to write a post now and then. The subject
of the posts are about webdevelopment in general and JavaScript in specific.

#### About me
I got hooked on the web right after building my first webpage in Netscape Composer. Since then i've
been busy exploring all kinds of techniques. Currently working at [Blendle](https://blendle.com) 
where I work on the main website.
